      <h3>Grip - Wearable Technology Concept/Case Study</h3>
      <p>Your hands are the most valuable tools you will ever own. After researching current wearable technologies, I developed a conceptual wearable and companion app with the goal of preventing long term damage to an artist's hands.</p>

      <h3>Mock SAAS Website - FundFriend</h3>
      <p>As a practice assignment, I was tasked with creating a brand and many of its assets. The only content I was given to work with was a brief descriptor from the client about themselves and their target audience, as well as some research into their competition.
      The result was a fully functional SAAS website, completely branded with Fundfriend's personality and style.</p>
