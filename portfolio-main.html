      <h3>Mock SAAS Website - FundFriend</h3>
      <p>As a practice assignment, I was tasked with creating a brand and many of its assets. The only content I was given to work with was a brief descriptor from the client about themselves and their target audience, as well as some research into their competition.
      The result was a fully functional SAAS website, completely branded with Fundfriend's personality and style.</p>
