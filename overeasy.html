  <p>My client was Fundfriend and their SAAS product, an online finance management service. It’s designed to help customers get organized and gain confidence in their banking by offering an easy-to-learn service and condensing their various banking accounts - Scotiabank, Royal Bank, Paypal, VISA, or what have you - under the FundFriend umbrella. It allows users to make online purchases, set budgets, track their spending, earn redeemable reward points, and more.</p>
      <p>The goal of this project was to create a website that strongly displayed the brand’s identity and allowed a user to easily find information on the product, and ultimately, to sign up for it.</p>


  <h2>The Method</h2>

  <p>I was supplied with some basic research from the client of their target audience and their competitors. It included two personas, which gave me an idea of the audience I was catering to and what they wanted. I also got a few examples of competing SAAS websites, such as Mint.com. This allowed me to get a grasp on the current trends that are commonly used in this type of SAAS website. I’ll go over those in a moment.</p>

  <h3>Prototypes  and Testing</h3>
  <p>I then proceeded to the sketching stage, playing around with several variations of layout and tested out the flow of my website, as you can see here.</p>
  <p>Once the wireframes were complete, the website was tested with five students from the Graphic Design program. The usability testing was formatted to test the effectiveness of the navigation, and overall, I met positive results.</p>
  <p>I made a few tweaks in button size & placement, based on my feedback, and the prototype was ready to go.</p>

  <h3>Brand development</h3>

  <p>By now, I had a feeling for who FundFriend was as a company, so it was time to develop the brand. The main idea I wanted to communicate with trustworthiness, since that’s essential in a banking company. The design scheme I developed was business-centric and clean, and the language used in the copy is aiming to be friendly and knowledgeable. I used a brighter colour palette to keep it fresh and modern and to distance it from a traditional bank.</p>

  <h2>The Result</h2>

  <p>Over all, this minimalistic, fresh take on app design will strongly resonate with the target audience, be very accessible and appealing, and ultimately, help a user to create delicious egg based meals. </p>
