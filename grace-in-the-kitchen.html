  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>The objective behind this project was to find a smaller, local company with a logo that we wanted to give a facelift. I chose Grace in the Kitchen, a kitchen supply shop in Kanata. I chose them because it is a store I’ve visited several times, and one that I greatly enjoy going to. I knew that they deserved a better logo than the one they had, as it didn’t reflect the quality of their products or type of business they are.</p>

  <h2>My Research</h2>
  <p>After visiting the store with fresh eyes and chatting with a few of the customers, I composed a brief to give me an idea of the direction I should take. Some of Grace in the Kitchen’s values include:</p>

  <h2>The Logo</h2>
  <p>
  <p>My main concern with the logo was that I wanted to make it obvious what type of store it is. I didn’t want it to be confused for a restaurant’s logo, or the logo of a specialty food’s store. I wanted it to be clear that this is a store that offers gear for professional chefs, passionate hobbyists, and beginner cooks alike. I
also wanted to be sure to express the emotions and concepts the client wanted, especially
“professional, friendly, and welcoming”, since these are critical to the client.</p>
  <p>I chose two utensils that I thought would make this idea very clear - a whisk, to symbolize baking and the home, and a knife, to symbolize many different kinds of preparation and professionalism. With these two tools, a wide range of activities in the kitchen is covered and displayed.</p>
  <p>I crossed them together to make a crest shape, and put them on a coloured background to help them to stand out from any other elements that may be around it and fighting for attention.</p>
  <h3>Color Choice</h3>
  <p>I chose to go for a deeply saturated colour scheme, focusing on rich reds and pale, warm tones, in order to give the impression of class and sophistication. I used the deep red again in the word “grace”, and the lighter cream colour in the word “kitchen”, to help tie them all together.</p>
  <h3>The Wordmark</h3>
  <p>I wanted to put lots of emphasis on the word “grace”, and to be sure to make the word itself graceful. I hand drew the capital G and used <i>Lush Script</i> for the rest of the word. The typeface works seamlessly with the hand type, and gives off the feeling of grace and flow without being overly formal.</p>
  <p>The rest of the words, ‘in the kitchen’, are written in <i>Proxima Nova Soft</i>. I chose this font because of its solid feeling and mono-weight, which strongly contrast the fluidity and changing weight of ‘grace’. This typeface supplies the friendly, welcoming style that I wanted to convey in the wordmark.</p>

  <h2>Brand Guidelines</h2>
  <p>As an extra step, I put together a booklet of brand guidelines. It includes how to use the logo, how much space to leave around it, some potential uses of the logo on merchandise, and more.
