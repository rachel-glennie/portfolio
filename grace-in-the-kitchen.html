  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>The objective behind this project was to find a smaller, local company with a logo that we wanted to give a facelift. I chose Grace in the Kitchen, a kitchen supply shop in Kanata. I chose them because it is a store I’ve visited several times, and one that I greatly enjoy going to. I knew that they deserved a better logo than the one they had, as it didn’t reflect the quality of their products or type of business they are.</p>

  <h2>My Research</h2>
  <p>After visiting the store with design in mind and chatting with a few of the customers, I composed a brief to give me an idea of the direction I should take. I decided the store's tone was mainly focused around these key attributes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>trustworthy and strong</li>
    <li>sleek and classy</li>
    <li>professional and sophisticated</li>
    <li>welcoming and friendly</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In terms of their target audience, they're mostly selling to those who enjoy gourmet foods and cooking, and who want to equip themselves with top-notch tools and quality ingredients. These people usually have a larger income and a strong appreciation for high quality foods. They understand the importance of eating right, and that special tools are required to get the job done. The target audience consists of anyone from an industry professional or a dedicated hobbyist.</p>
  <h2>The Logo</h2>
  <p>
  <p>My main concern with the logo was that I wanted to make it obvious what type of store it is. I didn’t want it to be confused for a restaurant’s logo, or the logo of a specialty food’s store. I wanted it to be clear that this is a store that offers gear for professional chefs, passionate hobbyists, and beginner cooks alike. I
also wanted to be sure to express the emotions and concepts the client wanted, especially
“professional, friendly, and welcoming”, since these are critical to the client.</p>
  <p>I chose two utensils that I thought would make this idea very clear - a whisk, to symbolize baking and the home, and a knife, to symbolize many different kinds of preparation and professionalism. With these two tools, a wide range of activities in the kitchen is covered and displayed.</p>
  <p>I crossed them together to make a crest shape, and put them on a coloured background to help them to stand out from any other elements that may be around it and fighting for attention.</p>
  <h3>Color Choice</h3>
  <p>I chose to go for a deeply saturated colour scheme, focusing on rich reds and pale, warm tones, in order to give the impression of class and sophistication. I used the deep red again in the word “grace”, and the lighter cream colour in the word “kitchen”, to help tie them all together.</p>
  <h3>The Wordmark</h3>
  <p>I wanted to put lots of emphasis on the word “grace”, and to be sure to make the word itself graceful. I hand drew the capital G and used <i>Lush Script</i> for the rest of the word. The typeface works seamlessly with the hand type, and gives off the feeling of grace and flow without being overly formal.</p>
  <p>The rest of the words, ‘in the kitchen’, are written in <i>Proxima Nova Soft</i>. I chose this font because of its solid feeling and mono-weight, which strongly contrast the fluidity and changing weight of ‘grace’. This typeface supplies the friendly, welcoming style that I wanted to convey in the wordmark.</p>

  <h2>Brand Guidelines</h2>
  <p>As an extra step, I put together a booklet of brand guidelines. It includes how to use the logo, how much space to leave around it, some potential uses of the logo on merchandise, and more.

  <h2>The Result</h2>
  <p> The fresh logo gives Grace in the Kitchen a professional and cutting edge look, which is exactly what they should be known for. This
new face will provide a new and modern identity for the company, and will help to draw in new business.
By emulating class and sophistication, it speaks more deeply to the target audience. There is also no longer any confusion as to exactly what kind of store Grace in the
Kitchen is - it won’t be confused for an eatery anymore. This clarity will help to draw in more intent
buyers and culinary professionals. Through sleek and simplistic design, the logo catches up to the
modern day, and it also catches the eye of the viewer.</p>
