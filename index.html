  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <strong>Hi there! I’m Rachel, a graduating graphic designer.</strong>
  <p>I take pride in my enthusiasm, my easy-going attitude, and my ability to guess dog breeds (I’m still working on that last one).</p>
  <p>Ever since I was little, I’ve always loved storytelling and creating things. Over the years, this passion has evolved into creative communication through words, graphics, sketches and concepts, and solutions to the problems life presents us. I believe that every aspect of an experience needs to be carefully considered and inspected from all the possible angles. Every piece matters!</p>
  <p>My design interests range from content creation to app development to typography, and a bit of everything in between.
  <p>When I'm not working or developing a self project, I dabble in different types of crafts (lots of felt creations and chainmaille pieces), explore the outdoors, read fiction, and enjoy a wide range of video games.</p>
