    <p>Grip is a <strong>wrist posture and grip tracking smart glove</strong> that enables artists to monitor and maintain the health of their wrist and joints. The goal is to prevent long term damage by suggesting exercises based on the data gathered by the glove.</p>

  <p>As a school assignment, I was tasked with conceptualizing a piece of wearable technology and an accompanying app. I chose to look at my surroundings for issues that designers and artists face while they’re going about their work. Specifically, I tried to watch for places where exist ing tools or objects could be used to further enhance or improve an experience.</p>
  <p>An area that caught my interest was the design industry and the physical health of our hands. Having a weak wrist or hand is very detrimental to artists. The effects can range from an annoyance and a bother to being completely unable to continue their work or passion. This leads to stress and worry, as well as the obvious physical pain.</p>
  <p>An <strong>artist’s glove</strong> is a place that I decided would be an excellent opportunity to use wearable technology. The gloves are currently focused on keeping your paper or tablet screen free of smudges and to protect your hand from the heat. They're usually made from a sports compression material, which has the benefits of being breathable and comfortable. The microfibers lining the fourth and fifth fingers allow you to rest the heel of your hand on the tablet without worrying about scratching or smudging it. These gloves were the perfect place to implement smart technology.</p>
